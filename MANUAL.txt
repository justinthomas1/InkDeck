Section 3: How to send messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. First, you'll need someone else's public key. Have them send it to you via e-mail or another file sharing service. Send them yours, too!

2. Using the "Select Public Key" and "Select Private Key", select the public key of the individual you'd like to send a message to and your own private key.

3. Type out a message in InkDeck. Make it as long or short as you'd like.

4. Click on the toolbar File>Encrypt to open a dialog box. This will ask where you'd like to save the encrypted file and what you'd like to name it.

5. Send the message to your recipient of choice via e-mail or another file sharing service.

6. When they send an encrypted text file back, open InkDeck.

7. Click on the toolbar File>Decrypt to open a dialog box. This will ask what file you'd like to open. Select the text file you received.

8. You should see the unencrypted contents of the file displayed in the text area.

9. Continue for any messages you'd like to send.
